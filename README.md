I would start by finding out exactly what the user would like within the program, then find out who the target audience is and build a user story upon that. I would say user stories help significantly as they can help keep you on track during thr development process.

First when developing programs, you want to look at the user stories you made and then find a good course of action, like programming language, program architecture, and development cycle.

A good team member is someone who helps out, contributes, and has good comunication. A good team member will also ask question, and give good detailed feedback.
